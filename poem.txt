Yesterday Was No Day To Be Gay

Yesterday Was No Day To Be Gay,
There Were Dark Things Afoot, And Dark Games They'd Play
And Maybe Tomorrow, I'll Wallow In Sorrow
Or In A Few Days, I'll Feel Trapped In A Maze
But Today, All Dark Things Are Away
I'll Do All I Can To Keep Them At Bay
Today Is The Day, For Great Games I To Play
Today Is The Day, I Will Sit And Be Gay.
